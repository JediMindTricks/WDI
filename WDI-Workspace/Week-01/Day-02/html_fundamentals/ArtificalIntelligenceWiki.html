		<h1>Artifical Intelligence</h1>
		<p>Artificial intelligence (AI) is intelligence exhibited by machines. In computer science, an ideal "intelligent" machine is a flexible rational agent that perceives its environment and takes actions that maximize its chance of success at some goal. Colloquially, the term "artificial intelligence" is applied when a machine mimics "cognitive" functions that humans associate with other human minds, such as "learning" and "problem solving". As machines become increasingly capable, mental facilities once thought to require intelligence are removed from the definition. For example, optical character recognition is no longer perceived as an exemplar of "artificial intelligence", having become a routine technology. Capabilities currently classified as AI include successfully understanding human speech, competing at a high level in strategic game systems (such as Chess and Go), self-driving cars, and interpreting complex data. AI is also considered a danger to humanity if it progresses unabatedly. AI research is divided into subfields that focus on specific problems or on specific approaches or on the use of a particular tool or towards satisfying particular applications.</p>

			<h2>History</h2>
			<p>
				While the concept of thought capable artificial beings appeared as storytelling devices in antiquity, the idea of actually trying to build a machine to perform useful reasoning may have begun with Ramon Llull (c. 1300 CE). With his Calculus ratiocinator, Gottfried Leibniz extended the concept of the calculating machine (Wilhelm Schickard engineered the first one around 1623), intending to perform operations on concepts rather than numbers. Since the 19th century, artificial beings are common in fiction, as in Mary Shelley's Frankenstein or Karel ÄŒapek's R.U.R. (Rossum's Universal Robots).

				According to Bloomberg, 2015 has been a landmark year for artificial intelligence because computers are smarter and learning faster than ever. Since 2012, the number of softwares that uses AI within Google has increased from a 100 to more than 2,700 softwares as of today. Since 2011, AI computers have improved significantly in making errors. The advancement of AI is speeding up. Google, Facebook, and Microsoft all operate its own AI lab that conducts important research in the field and publishes much of it for the academic community to build upon.[39] Microsoft developed a Skype system that can automatically translate from one language to another and Facebook has built a way to let computers describe images to blind people. These examples make 2015 a revolutionary year for artificial intelligence.

			<h2>Research</h2>
			<p>
				The general problem of simulating (or creating) intelligence has been broken down into sub-problems. These consist of particular traits or capabilities that researchers expect an intelligent system to display. The traits described below have received the most attention.

		<div id="Applications">
			<h2>Applications</h2>
			<p>
				AI is relevant to any intellectual task. Modern artificial intelligence techniques are pervasive and are too numerous to list here. Frequently, when a technique reaches mainstream use, it is no longer considered artificial intelligence; this phenomenon is described as the AI effect.

				High-profile examples of AI include autonomous vehicles (such as drones and self-driving cars), medical diagnosis, creating art (such as poetry), proving mathematical theorems, playing games (such as Chess or Go), search engines (such as Google search), online assistants (such as Siri), image recognition in photographs, spam filtering, prediction of judicial decisions [201] and targeting online advertisements.

				With social media sites overtaking TV as a source for news for young people and news organisations increasingly reliant on social media platforms for generating distribution,[204] major publishers now use artificial intelligence (AI) technology to post stories more effectively and generate higher volumes of traffic.

		<div id="Platforms">
			<h2>Platforms</h2>
			<p>
				A platform (or "computing platform") is defined as "some sort of hardware architecture or software framework (including application frameworks), that allows software to run." As Rodney Brooks pointed out many years ago, it is not just the artificial intelligence software that defines the AI features of the platform, but rather the actual platform itself that affects the AI that results, i.e., there needs to be work in AI problems on real-world platforms rather than in isolation.

		<div id="Philosophy">
			<h2>Philosophy</h2>
			<p>
				There are three philosophical questions related to AI:
				<ol>
					<li>Is artificial general intelligence possible? Can a machine solve any problem that a human being can solve using intelligence? Or are there hard limits to what a machine can accomplish?</li>
					<li>Are intelligent machines dangerous? How can we ensure that machines behave ethically and that they are used ethically?</li>
					<li>Can a machine have a mind, consciousness and mental states in exactly the same sense that human beings do? Can a machine be sentient, and thus deserve certain rights? Can a machine intentionally cause harm?</li>
				</ol>
